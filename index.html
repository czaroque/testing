			<p>hi kath i think i know that may hint kana, pero i think that you're not the type to assume so ingnon nalang nako saimoha STRAIGHT! crush tika</p>
			<p>unta dili ta ma awkward, please!! HAHAHAHHAHA. i enjoy talking to you in person and sa pm</p>
			<p>i really value the times i spent talking to you. i think cool kaayo ka with how you balance your life. hawd kayka maggames, hawd pud ka sa school, hawd pajud ka mag write, unsa may dili nimo kaya?</p>
			<p>i am confessing for the sake na i-express ang feelings ko, and i think that you should also know. ayaw ko mag come off as mixed signals and i want to make it as clear as possible for you.</p>
			<p>i am not expecting na reciprocated agad ang feelings ko, pero if you give me a chance to prove mself, i will make sure to make your consideration worthwhile.</p>
